# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Background
- Telecommunications service providers have become a necessity in the era of technology that is moving rapidly this century.
- The quality of services provided by telecommunications providers causes various responses from customers.
- Often the problem of satisfaction with the use of telecommunications services from certain providers is a strong reason for customers to choose to stay or leave/churn and switch to competitors.

## Objective
This project aims to: 
- Analyze customer churn rate from the use of telecommunication services
- Perform machine learning modeling to predict churn
- Search for the best machine learning model to predict customer churn rate
- Provide the best suggestions for business strategy improvement based on this case study

## Source of Dataset
The processed dataset is obtained from:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics

## Machine Learning Models:
There are three machine learning modeling used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- K-NN

## Result
Machine learning modeling to predict churn rate:
1. The random forest classifier got 92% and 88% accuracy (with hyperparameter tuning).
2. XGBoost got 86% and 92% accuracy (with hyperparameter tuning).
3. K-NN got 83% and 90% accuracy (with hyperparameter tuning).
4. Random forest and XGBoost models are recommended to predict the churn rate.
5. Stakeholders can provide concrete actions to establish relevant marketing strategies for customers who churn, which is predicted by machine learning of approximately 90%.
